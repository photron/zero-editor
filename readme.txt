Zero Editor
===========

I've used many different text/code editors and IDEs through the years. There
are some good out there, but most are mediocre.

The typical problem is that most editors and IDEs try to appeal to a broad
audience, which results in providing a broad set of features. This in turn
often results in a cluttered user interface with complex menu structures. Even
worse are long menus without icons that would help to simplify spotting the
action one is looking for.

Then there are features I tend to struggle with, because I never use them, but
trigger them by accident. For example, zooming using ctrl key + mouse wheel or
enabling overwrite mode with the insert key or full screen mode or duplicating
the current line using a hotkey or toggling two lines using a hotkey.

So I'm a the point now where I say "screw you!" and create my own code editor
that only has the features I need that work in the way I prefer. It'll have
exactly zero features that I don't need, hence the name: Zero Editor.
